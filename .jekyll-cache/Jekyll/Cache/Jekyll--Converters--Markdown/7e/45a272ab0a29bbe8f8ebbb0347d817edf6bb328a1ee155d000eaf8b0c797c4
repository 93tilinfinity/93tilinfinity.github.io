I"–<p>So far, weâ€™ve had problems with our relational database. As with any learning scenario, the best thing to do with problems is to learn from them.</p>

<p>Here is a list of desirable properties of a data system. Where do relational databases fail with respect to these properties?</p>

<p>1) <strong>Robustness/fault tolerance</strong> â€“ the ability of your data system to provide the right information in the face of the challenges involved with using, maintaining &amp; growing your service.</p>

<p>2) <strong>Low latency</strong> â€“ the ability to provide the right information when you need it.</p>

<p>3) <strong>Scalable</strong> â€“ the ability to maintain performance in the face of increasing data or load by adding resources to the system.</p>

<p>4) <strong>Generalised</strong> â€“ the ability of your data system to satisfy a range of use cases.</p>

<p>5) <strong>Extensible</strong> â€“ the ability to allow functionality to be added with minimal development cost.</p>

<p>6) <strong>Minimal maintenance</strong> â€“ self-explanatory. Largely depends on implementation complexity i.e. how easy the system is to reason with.</p>

<p>7) <strong>Debuggability</strong> â€“ the ability to trace the source for each value in the system.</p>

<p>8) <strong>Ad hoc queries</strong> â€“ the ability to arbitrarily mine your dataset. This ability opens the door to discover interesting facets of your datasets.</p>

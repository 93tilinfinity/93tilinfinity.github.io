I"r<p>:metal: Hello,</p>

<p>I’m a starter/data analyst/engineer/scientist/consultant at <a href="https://www.scarletteai.com">Scarlette AI</a>.</p>

<p>:round_pushpin: Based in London, I’m <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Indians">British Indian</a> :uk::india:.</p>

<p>:mortar_board: My academic background is a mix of maths, statistics and economics. I went to the University of Warwick, UK. 
My masters topic was about comparing <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12eZWG0Z5gY">Markov Chain Monte Carlo</a> techniques to approximate difficult integrals.</p>

<p>I got roped into financial markets after reading <a href="https://www.trendfollowing.com/whitepaper/Edwin_LeFevre_Reminiscences_of_a_Stock_Operator.pdf">Reminiscences of a Stock Operator</a>
 and began trading interest rate options at Barclays Investment Bank. 
 There I discovered that I view things like a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Necker_cube">cube</a> - I register many
perspectives easily. I found that ingesting important data in the right format gave me clarity when decision-making
and led to more black numbers :chart_with_upwards_trend: and less <a href="https://twitter.com/GSElevator/status/143459992618545152">red</a>
numbers :chart_with_downwards_trend: in my PnL.
My mind was blown by the possibilities exposed by a little Python programming :snake:, system design and business knowledge, 
 so I paused life in trading.</p>

<p>I moved onto recommendation systems. Building, analysing, criticising and <a href="https://towardsdatascience.com/4-ways-to-supercharge-your-recommendation-system-aeac34678ce9">writing about them</a>. 
The machine learning space is huge from a research perspective and an even larger expanse when factoring in implementation. 
I picked only recommendation systems &amp; unsupervised learning and decided to deep dive; end-to-end fun. You
can find some of my open-source projects on <a href="https://github.com/93tilinfinity">GitHub</a>. Along the way, I started began
making data chill at <a href="https://www.scarletteai.com">www.scarletteai.com</a>.</p>

<p>I enjoy <a href="https://www.zwift.com/news/5082-zwift-how-to-joining-a-zwifter-on-a-ride#:~:text=The%20easiest%20way%20to%20add,in%20the%20top%20right%20corner.">cycling</a> 
:bicyclist::dash:, making music :saxophone: (soundcloud coming soon?), taking everyday objects apart and 
sometimes putting them together :construction_worker:. I love discussing all things <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_general_intelligence">AGI</a>
 :robot:. I have a sister who fixes teeth. We ran an <a href="https://www.instagram.com/feed.bucks/">online food marketplace social
 entreprise</a> :pizza: together throughout 2020.</p>

<p>“What you celebrate is what your culture will be.”</p>

<ul>
  <li>Solving puzzles</li>
  <li>Mastery</li>
  <li>Unexpected generosity</li>
  <li>Integrity in difficult situations</li>
</ul>

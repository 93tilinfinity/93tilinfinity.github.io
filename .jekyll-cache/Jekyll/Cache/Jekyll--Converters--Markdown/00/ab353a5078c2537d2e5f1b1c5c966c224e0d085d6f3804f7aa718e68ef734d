I"Ä<p>:metal: Hello,</p>

<p>I‚Äôm a founder/data analyst/engineer/scientist at Scarlette AI.</p>

<p>:round_pushpin: Based in London, I‚Äôm British-born Indian :uk::india:.</p>

<p>:mortar_board: My academic background is a mix of maths, statistics and economics. I went to the University of Warwick, UK. 
My masters topic was about comparing Markov Chain Monte Carlo techniques to approximate difficult integrals.</p>

<p>I got roped into financial markets after reading The Reminiscences of a Stock Operator and began trading interest rate 
options at Barclays Investment Bank. There I discovered that I view things like a cube - I register many
perspectives easily. I found that ingesting important data in the right format gave me clarity when decision making
and led to more good PnL days :chart_with_upwards_trend: and less bad PnL days :chart_with_downwards_trend:.
I couldn‚Äôt quite get over the possibilities exposed by a little Python programming :snake:, system design and business knowledge. 
So I paused life in trading.</p>

<p>I started with recommendation systems. Building, analysing, criticising and writing about them. I realise the space of 
machine learning and data science is vast from a research perspective but an even larger expanse from an 
implementation perspective. I picked recommendation systems &amp; unsupervised learning and decided to deep dive. You
can find some of my projects here. A precursor doing good things with data is to have a great way to move data around.</p>

<p>I spend time cycling :bicyclist:, making music :saxophone: (soundcloud coming soon?), taking everyday objects apart and 
sometimes putting them together. I love discussing all things AGI :robot:. I have a sister who‚Äôs into teeth, who happened to run an online food marketplace social
 entreprise :pizza: with me throughout 2020.</p>

<p>‚ÄúCulture is set by what you choose to celebrate.‚Äù, I celebrate the following:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Mastery</li>
  <li>Unexpected generosity</li>
  <li>Integrity in difficult situations</li>
</ul>

I"Æ<p>Built to last. Always delivers. GOAT.</p>

<p>I want a data system like Tom Brady.</p>

<p>Weâ€™ve had problems with relational databases. They arenâ€™t Superbowl worthy. So, what data systems are?
Or better yet, what general properties do help a data system achieve GOAT status?</p>

<p>Here is what I have arrived at after limited research: (order and importance tbd)</p>

<p>1) <strong>Robustness/fault tolerance</strong> â€“ the ability to provide the right information in the face of the challenges involved with using, maintaining &amp; growing your service.</p>

<p>2) <strong>Low latency</strong> â€“ the ability to provide the right information when you need it.</p>

<p>3) <strong>Scalable</strong> â€“ the ability to maintain performance in the face of increasing data or load by adding resources to the system.</p>

<p>4) <strong>Generalised</strong> â€“ the ability to satisfy a range of use cases.</p>

<p>5) <strong>Extensible</strong> â€“ the ability to allow functionality to be added with minimal development cost.</p>

<p>6) <strong>Minimal maintenance</strong> â€“ self-explanatory. Largely depends on implementation complexity i.e. how easy the system is to reason with.</p>

<p>7) <strong>Debuggability</strong> â€“ the ability to trace the source for each value in the system.</p>

<p>8) <strong>Ad hoc queries</strong> â€“ the ability to arbitrarily mine your dataset. This ability opens the door to discover interesting facets of your datasets.</p>

<p>:metal: Hello,</p>

<p>I’m a entrepreneur/data analyst/engineer/scientist at <a href="https://www.scarletteai.com">Scarlette AI</a>.</p>

<p>:round_pushpin: Based in London, I’m <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Indians">British Indian</a> :uk::india:.</p>

<p>:mortar_board: My academic background is a mix of maths, statistics and economics. I went to the University of Warwick, UK. 
My masters topic was about comparing <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12eZWG0Z5gY">Markov Chain Monte Carlo</a> techniques to approximate difficult integrals.</p>

<p>I got roped into financial markets after reading <a href="https://www.trendfollowing.com/whitepaper/Edwin_LeFevre_Reminiscences_of_a_Stock_Operator.pdf">Reminiscences of a Stock Operator</a>
 and began trading interest rate options at Barclays Investment Bank. 
 There I discovered that I view things like a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Necker_cube">cube</a> - I register many
perspectives easily. I found that ingesting important data in the right format gave me clarity when decision making
and led to more black numbers :chart_with_upwards_trend: and less (red)[https://twitter.com/GSElevator/status/143459992618545152] 
numbers :chart_with_downwards_trend:.
I couldn’t quite get over the possibilities exposed by a little Python programming :snake:, system design and business knowledge. 
So I paused life in trading.</p>

<p>I started with recommendation systems. Building, analysing, criticising and writing about them. I realise the space of 
machine learning and data science is vast from a research perspective but an even larger expanse from an 
implementation perspective. I picked recommendation systems &amp; unsupervised learning and decided to deep dive. You
can find some of my projects here. A precursor doing good things with data is to have a great way to move data around.</p>

<p>I like cycling fast :bicyclist::dash:, making music :saxophone: (soundcloud coming soon?), taking everyday objects apart and 
sometimes putting them together :construction_worker:. I love discussing all things AGI :robot:. 
I have a sister who fixes teeth :grinning: and who happened to run an online food marketplace social
 entreprise :pizza: with me throughout 2020.</p>

<p>“Culture is set by what you choose to celebrate.”, I celebrate the following:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Mastery</li>
  <li>Unexpected generosity</li>
  <li>Integrity in difficult situations</li>
</ul>

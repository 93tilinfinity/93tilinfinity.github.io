I"Y<p>:metal: Hello,</p>

<p>I’m a founder/data analyst/engineer/scientist at Scarlette AI. I’m second-generation British :uk: &amp; based in 
London. My academic background is a mix of maths, statistics and economics :school_satchel: from the University of Warwick. 
My masters topic was about approximating integrals of intractable distributions using a couple different 
Markov Chain Monte Carlo techniques.</p>

<p>I got roped into financial markets after reading The Reminiscences of a Stock Operator and began trading interest rate 
options at Barclays. There I learnt that I view things in the world like viewing a cube - I register many perspectives 
on a particular thing easily. I found that ingesting important data in the right format helped me pick the perspective 
I believed in and led to more black numbers and less red numbers in my trading PnL. Once I automated my process, I couldn’t 
quite get over the possibilities exposed by a little Python programming, system design and business knowledge.
So I paused life in trading.</p>

<p>I started with recommendation systems. Building, analysing, criticising and writing about them. I realise the space of 
machine learning and data science is vast from a research perspective but an even larger expanse from an 
implementation perspective. I picked recommendation systems &amp; unsupervised learning and decided to deep dive. You
can find some of my projects here. A precursor doing good things with data is to have a great way to move data around.</p>

<p>Besides work, I spend time cycling, making music (soundcloud coming soon), doing anything DIY and discuss all things AGI. 
I have a sister who’s into teeth, who happened to run an online food marketplace social entreprise with me throughout 2020.</p>

<p>In my eyes, culture is set by what you choose to celebrate. I celebrate the following:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Mastery</li>
  <li>Unexpected generosity</li>
  <li>Integrity in difficult situations</li>
</ul>

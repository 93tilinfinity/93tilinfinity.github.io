So far, we’ve had problems with our relational database. As with any learning scenario, the best thing to do with problems is to learn from them. 

Below I have put together a list of desirable properties of a data system. Where do relational databases fail with respect to these properties?

1) **Robustness/fault tolerance** – the ability of your data system to provide the right information in the face of the challenges involved with using, maintaining & growing your service.

2) **Low latency** – the ability to provide the right information when you need it. 

3) **Scalable** – the ability to maintain performance in the face of increasing data or load by adding resources to the system.

4) **Generalised** – the ability of your data system to satisfy a range of use cases.

5) **Extensible** – the ability to allow functionality to be added with minimal development cost.

6) **Minimal maintenance** – self-explanatory. Largely depends on implementation complexity i.e. how easy the system is to reason with. 

7) **Debuggability** – the ability to trace the source for each value in the system.

8) **Ad hoc queries** – the ability to arbitrarily mine your dataset. This ability opens the door to discover interesting facets of your datasets.

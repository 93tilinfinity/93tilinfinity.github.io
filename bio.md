:metal: Hello, I'm Neil. I design & build data systems at [Scarlette AI](https://www.scarletteai.com). I also write
 about my experiences wtih [applied statistics](https://medium.com/@neil.chandarana18) & [data systems](https://www.neilchandarana.com/).

Currently, I'm working on [WhatPrinted?](https://www.whatprinted.com), a realtime analytics dashboard to people 
trade a collection of interest rate derivatives called [swaptions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swaption). 

In the past, I started a mini deliveroo - a [food delivery platform](https://www.instagram.com/feed.bucks/) in my local area. 
And before that, was an interest rate derivatives trader at Barclays Investment Bank. All the while, developing my own [programming projects](https://github.com/93tilinfinity). 

I particularly enjoy trying to improve the quality of life using code. 
For example, I used my heartrate data from Garmin and power data from Wattbike to attempt going from beginner to a 300 Watt FTP. 
I got to 272 Watt FTP. Partially documented [here](https://towardsdatascience.com/machine-learning-cycling-300w-ftp-part-1-2abb04b30036).

Here are some quick facts:
* :uk::india: I'm [British Indian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Indians) and based in London, UK.
* :mortar_board: I went to the University of Warwick. My masters was about approximating integrals using [Markov Chain Monte Carlo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12eZWG0Z5gY) techniques.
* [Reminiscences of a Stock Operator](https://www.trendfollowing.com/whitepaper/Edwin_LeFevre_Reminiscences_of_a_Stock_Operator.pdf) made me decide to become a trader.
* But I found something more exciting - making something from nothing using code. Soon after, I left trading.
* I'm excited about unsupervised learning. I like the idea of discovering core principles. I love the idea of discovering truth.

:metal: Hello,

I build data systems at [Scarlette AI](https://www.scarletteai.com). I'm currently building a realtime analytics dashboard to
people trade interest rate derivatives. 

:round_pushpin: Based in London, I'm [British Indian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Indians) :uk::india:.
 
:mortar_board: My academic background is a mix of maths, statistics and economics. I went to the incredibly well known University of Warwick, UK. 
My masters topic was about approximating difficult integrals using [Markov Chain Monte Carlo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12eZWG0Z5gY) techniques.

Whilst at university, I read [Reminiscences of a Stock Operator](https://www.trendfollowing.com/whitepaper/Edwin_LeFevre_Reminiscences_of_a_Stock_Operator.pdf),
 got hooked and decided to become a trader.
 
I moved back to London and soon began trading interest rate options at Barclays. 

There I found no strippers and no cocaine. Instead, I found something better. Programming. 

Learning to code was easier than attending IT prioritisation calls so I taught myself. Pretty soon it was clear that data displayed 
in just the right format made my life easier. That meant more black numbers :chart_with_upwards_trend: and less [red](https://twitter.com/GSElevator/status/143459992618545152)
numbers :chart_with_downwards_trend: in my PnL.

Convinced programming is the closest thing we have to magic, I paused life in trading.

A dozen [articles](https://towardsdatascience.com/4-ways-to-supercharge-your-recommendation-system-aeac34678ce9),
multiple [programming projects](https://github.com/93tilinfinity),
a [social enterprise](https://www.instagram.com/feed.bucks/) and a [YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4cQMryKwqA) later, 
I started my own tech consulting company - [Scarlette AI](https://www.scarletteai.com).

And that is where we are now.

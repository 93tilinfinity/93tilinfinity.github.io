Hello,

I'm a founder/data analyst/engineer/scientist at Scarlette AI. I'm second-generation British. I went to university in
the UK and my academic background is a mix of maths, statistics and economics. My masters topic was about approximating
integrals of intractable distributions using a couple different Markov Chain Monte Carlo techniques. 

I got roped into financial markets after reading The Reminiscences of a Stock Operator and began trading interest rate 
options at Barclays. There I learnt that I view things in the world like viewing a cube - I register many perspectives 
on a particular thing easily. I found that ingesting important data in the right format helped me pick the perspective 
I believed in and led to way more black numbers and less red numbers in my PnL. Once automated my process, I couldn't 
quite get over the possibilities exposed by a bit of Python programming, data system design and business knowledge.
So I paused life in trading.

I started with recommendation systems. Building, analysing, criticising and writing about them. I realise the space of 
machine learning and data science is vast from a research perspective but an even larger expanse from an 
implementation perspective. I picked recommendation systems & unsupervised learning and decided to deep dive. You
can find some of my projects here. A precursor doing good things with data is to have a great way to move data around. 

Besides work, I spend time cycling, making music (soundcloud coming soon), doing anything DIY and discuss all this AGI. 
I have a sister who's into teeth, who happened to run an online food marketplace social entreprise with me throughout 2020. 

In my eyes, culture is set by what you choose to celebrate. I celebrate the following:
* Mastery
* Unexpected generosity
* Integrity in difficult situations

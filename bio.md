:metal: Hello,

I build data systems at [Scarlette AI](https://www.scarletteai.com). I'm currently working on realtime analytics for 
interest rate derivative traders, if you're in the space let's chat. 
Email me at [neil@scarletteai.com](mailto:neil@scarletteai.com).

"What you celebrate is what your culture will be." 

I celebrate:
* Solving problems
* Mastery
* Unexpected generosity
* Integrity in difficult situations

:round_pushpin: Based in London, I'm [British Indian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Indians) :uk::india:. 
 
:mortar_board: My academic background is a mix of maths, statistics and economics. I went to the University of Warwick, UK. 
My masters topic was about comparing [Markov Chain Monte Carlo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12eZWG0Z5gY) techniques to approximate difficult integrals.

I wanted to work in financial markets after reading [Reminiscences of a Stock Operator](https://www.trendfollowing.com/whitepaper/Edwin_LeFevre_Reminiscences_of_a_Stock_Operator.pdf)
 and began trading interest rate options at Barclays Investment Bank. 
 There I discovered that I view things like a [cube](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Necker_cube) - I register many
perspectives easily. I found that ingesting important data in the right format gave me clarity when decision-making.
That led to more black numbers :chart_with_upwards_trend: and less [red](https://twitter.com/GSElevator/status/143459992618545152)
numbers :chart_with_downwards_trend: in my PnL.
My mind was blown by the power of a little Python programming, system design and business knowledge, so I paused life in trading.

I moved onto recommendation systems. Building, analysing, criticising and [writing about them](https://towardsdatascience.com/4-ways-to-supercharge-your-recommendation-system-aeac34678ce9). 
The machine learning space is huge from a research perspective and an even larger expanse when factoring in implementation. 
I picked only recommendation systems & unsupervised learning and decided to deep dive; end-to-end fun. You
can find some of my open-source projects on [GitHub](https://github.com/93tilinfinity).

:bicyclist::dash:, making music :saxophone: (soundcloud coming soon?), taking everyday objects apart and 
sometimes putting them together :construction_worker:. I love discussing all things [AGI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_general_intelligence)
 :robot:. I have a sister who fixes teeth; we ran an [online food marketplace social
 entreprise](https://www.instagram.com/feed.bucks/) :pizza: together throughout 2020.

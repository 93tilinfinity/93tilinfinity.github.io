:metal: Hello,

I build data systems at [Scarlette AI](https://www.scarletteai.com). I'm currently building a realtime analytics dashboard to
people trade interest rate derivatives.

:round_pushpin: Based in London, I'm [British Indian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Indians) :uk::india:.
 
:mortar_board: My academic background is a mix of maths, statistics and economics. I went to the incredibly well-known University of Warwick, UK 
and my masters topic was about approximating difficult integrals using [Markov Chain Monte Carlo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12eZWG0Z5gY) techniques.

Whilst at university, I read [Reminiscences of a Stock Operator](https://www.trendfollowing.com/whitepaper/Edwin_LeFevre_Reminiscences_of_a_Stock_Operator.pdf),
 got hooked and decided to become a trader. So I moved back to London and soon began trading interest rate options at Barclays. 
 
There, I didn't find strippers nor cocaine. But I did find something better. Programming. 

Building my own systems was easier than attending IT prioritisation calls so that's what I did. Pretty soon it was clear that data displayed 
in just the right format made my life easier. That meant more black numbers :chart_with_upwards_trend: and less [red](https://twitter.com/GSElevator/status/143459992618545152)
numbers :chart_with_downwards_trend: in my PnL.

Convinced programming is the closest thing we have to magic, I paused life in trading.

A dozen [articles](https://towardsdatascience.com/4-ways-to-supercharge-your-recommendation-system-aeac34678ce9),
multiple [programming projects](https://github.com/93tilinfinity),
a [social enterprise](https://www.instagram.com/feed.bucks/) and a [YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4cQMryKwqA) later, 
I started my own tech consultancy - [Scarlette AI](https://www.scarletteai.com).

Beneath the veil of a registered comapany is nothing more than a framework for me to do meaningful work
with meaningful people. Sometimes that means spending all of my time doing work for my clients and other times that means
tuning down client work to focus on bootstrapping my own ideas. I enjoy that flexibility.

And that is where we are today.
